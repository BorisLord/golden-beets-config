"""Pass -- per-track AcoustID fingerprint verification: detect & quarantine IMPOSTER tracks.

An imposter has the right tags but its AUDIO is a different recording; album-mode import trusts it and
`chroma` doesn't penalise a track it can't ID, so it slips into a "strong" album. We act ONLY on POSITIVE
evidence: the fingerprint CONFIDENTLY matches a DIFFERENT artist's recording. Can't confirm, or a SAME-artist
match (alt mix/edition/typo) -> KEEP. Imposter -> MOVED to $MUSIC_DUMP (never deleted) + dropped. Cached per file.
